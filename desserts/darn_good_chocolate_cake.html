        <li>1 package (3.9 ounce) chocolate instant pudding mix</li>
        
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>

      <h3>Chocolate Icing</h3>
      <ul>
        
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        
        <li>5 Tbs. butter</li>
        
        <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
        
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        
      </ul>
        
      
    </div>
    <div class="right instructions">
      <ol>
      
        <li>
          <p>Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly mist a 12-cup Bundt pan with vegetable oil spray, then dust with flour. Shake out the excess flour. Set the pan aside. </p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <p>Place the cake mix, pudding mix, sour cream, water, oil and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Blend with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat 2 to 3 minutes more, scraping the sides down again if needed. The batter should look thick and well combined. Fold in the chocolate chips for the cake, making sure they are well distributed throughout the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it out with the rubber spatula. Place the pan in the oven.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <p>Bake the cake until springs back when lightly pressed with your finger and is just starting to pull away form the sides of the pan, 58 to 62 minutes. Run a long, sharp knife around the edge of the cake and invert it onto a rack to cool completely, 20 minutes more. </p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <p>Prepare the icing by placing the sugar, butter and milk in a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir until the mixture comes to a boil, 3 to 4 minutes. Still stirring, let the mixture boil until the sugar dissolves, 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the chocolate chips, and continue to stir until the mixture is smooth and the chocolate has melted.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <p>Place the cake on a serving platter and pour the warm icing over it. Let the cake rest for 10 minutes before slicing, then slice and serve. (Store this cake wrapped in aluminum foil or plastic wrap, or in a cake saver, at room temperature for up to 1 week. Or freeze it, wrapped in foil, for up to 6 months. Thaw the cake overnight in the refrigerator before serving.) </p>
